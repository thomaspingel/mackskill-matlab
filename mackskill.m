% The Mack-Skillings Statistical Test
% A nonparametric two-way ANOVA used for unbalanced incomplete block 
% designs, when the number of observations in each treatment/block pair is
% one or greater.  The test is equivalent to the Friedman test when
% balanced and there are no missing observations.
% 
% Syntax:
% [p stats] = mackskill(response, treatments, blocks)
% [p stats] = mackskill(M, reps)
%   This version assumes M is structured similar to a table in the function
%   friedman(), where columns are treatments (k) (the variable of interest), 
%   and rows are blocks (n) (a nuisance variable).  Reps (c)
%   corresponds to the maximum number of repeated observations.  
%   The M matrix should therefore have k columns and n*c rows.
%
% Example:
%
% The friedman() function uses popcorn data originally published by Hogg
% (1987).  From the text of that function:
% "The columns of the matrix popcorn are brands (Gourmet, National,
% and Generic). The rows are popper type (Oil and Air). The study popped 
% a batch of each brand three times with each popper. The values are the 
% yield in cups of popped popcorn."  Given that the data is structured this
% way, we must be asking "Which brand of popcorn pops the best, apart from
% the type of popper it is popped in."  k=3,n=2,c=3.
%
% load popcorn
% [p table stats] = friedman(popcorn,3);
% % chisq = 13.76
% % p = 0.001
% 
% If there are missing observations, use the Mack-Skilling test:
%
% popcorn(5) = NaN;
% [p stats] = mackskill(popcorn,3);
% stats.T = 8.5856
% stats.p = 0.0137
%
% 
% Example:
%
% Hollander and Wolfe (1999) describe the Mack-Skillings test in their
% example 7.9 "Determination of Niacin in Bran Flakes" on page 331, from
% data originally published in Campbell & Pelletier (1962).
%
% % Table 7.20  Amount of Niacin in Enriched Bran Flakes 
% %
% %         Enrichment (mg/100g of Bran Flakes)
% %          1            4           8
% M =       [7.58       11.63       15.00; ...  % lab 1
%           7.87        11.87       15.92; ...
%           7.71        11.40       15.58; ...
%           8.00        12.20       16.60; ... % lab 2
%           8.27        11.70       16.40; ...
%           8.00        11.80       15.90; ...
%           7.60        11.04       15.87; ... % lab 3
%           7.30        11.50       15.91; ...
%           7.82        11.49       16.28; ...
%           8.03        11.50       15.10; ... % lab 4
%           7.35        10.10       14.80; ...
%           7.66        11.70       15.70];
%
%
% However, we want to know whether the _labs_ are different, apart from the
% amount of niacin enrichment, or as Hollander and Wolfe put it, "Of
% primary interest here is the precision of the laboratory procedure for
% determining niacin content in bran flakes."  Our table is therefore not
% formatted correctly to call mackskill(M,3), as this would tell us whether
% our columns were notably different, apart from rows.
%
% We can reformat our data this way:
%
% [row enrichment niacin] = find(sparse(M)); 
% lab = ceil(row/3);  % 3, since there are 3 repetitions
% response = niacin; treatment = lab; block = enrichment;
%
% [p stats] = mackskill(response,treatment,block)
%
% stats.T  = 12.9274
% stats.df = 3
% stats.p  = 0.0048
%
% These results are equivalent to the test statistic in Hollander & Wolfe
% (1999), MS = 12.93 (page 332).
%
%
% The algorithm uses the chi-squared approximation for the p-value, which 
% should not be used when there are very few observations.  Please refer to
% the original text for a complete description.
